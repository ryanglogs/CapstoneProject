# CapstoneProject

This was a project that I worked on with 1 other person for the final capstone project for our degree. We originally wanted to create a web scraper using Python and a library called Selenium to scrape data off different social medias. However, we found it much easier to use the social media specific API's that were built for Python.  We then shifted into more of a web based API research project. In the final paper we wrote about the differences we found while trying to use the different API's. Some API's like Tweepy and Spotipy were very easy to understand and had really nice documentation. Other API's like Youtube and Google Maps were slightly more difficult to use but had really good documentation. Google Maps API does come with a small charge with every search you make though. 

This was all run locally using an Apache server from the XAMPP Control Panel. There was some initial setup required in order for python scripts to be able to run on the Apache server, but once they are enabled it was quite easy. The backend python script does require the CGI library in order to be able to print HTML code and have it displayed properly. There are other web platforms for Python such as Flask, but we found CGI to be the easiest for our use case.
